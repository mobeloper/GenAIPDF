If you see the following error when uploading files
"AxiosError: Request failed with status code 403"
it means the required cookie is not loading properly. You must have this in your Application cookies of the browser:
_streamlit_xsrf
For this you might need to update your version of tornado
I suggest running 
pip freeze 
to check your version of Tordado is least v6.1 (which I didnâ€™t) and then I ran 
run this command:
```
pip install -U tornado 
```
to upgrade to a more recent version.
After this clear the browser cache and do hard reload of your app, and make sure the correct _streamlit_xsrf cookie being saved in the browser cookie jar. 


Pydantic was added to solve issues with langchain running in python<3.9
```
pip install pydantic==1.10.8
```
